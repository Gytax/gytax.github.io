![Hi!](/assets/img/hi-mark.gif)

So, you'd like to know a little about me? Like just about everyone, I'm not the best in talking about myself, but I'll give it a go here, because you were so kind to take the effort to navigate to this page!

My name is Kevin. I'm Dutch. I generally like anything nerdy and geeky and I ended up doing more stuff like that for a job; I'm a software engineer.
I generally joke about anything and everything and especially love jokes that might be a little inappropriate.

I love metal music, horror and scifi movies, watch a lot of Twitch.tv and play a lot of video games.
I very much enjoy tinkering with things, mostly technology related like writing scripts for stuff I’m too lazy for, building keyboards, using QMK to make my own keymaps for those keyboards and setting up completely unnecessary things on my [NAS/home server](/posts/server/) or making my SteamDeck do things it was never meant for.

Nowadays, I mainly use Windows, since that's what runs on my [desktop](/posts/desktop/), however I tinker around in WSL a lot (like managing this blog through the use of Jekyll!) and my server runs TrueNAS Core, which is based on FreeBSD (on which, in turn, I also run a few Linux VM's).
Work-wise, I used to have a laptop running Arch Linux (with i3 as window manager) that I held on to for as long as I could. Sadly, the time came for me to replace that one...and now I have a 16" Macbook with an M1 Pro. My experience with Mac OS is mostly limited to complaining about why this damned OS doesn't do what I want it to do and trying to customize it. It's great hardware, but I am definitely not a fan of the OS (or Apple in general to be honest). Since we’ve started working from home, I have found a perfect solution though;
I SSH into my Macbook through VSCode remote so I keep my work dev stuff on my laptop and I can use my own desktop with my 3 screens and my vastly superior camera and audio setup to do meetings.
> If you're a dev and you haven’t tried VSCode remote, go try it! It’s quite amazing and I’m really excited about it.

About halfway through 2023, I picked up a new tinkering hobby; building Gundam plastic model kits. These kits come in a box filled with plastic bits you have to cut out of runners and then you click them together (no glue needed) to form an awesome robot that even has articulation. [Check them out, they're great!](/posts/gundam/).

Here's some random facts about me
### What's your favorite movie?
[Alien (1979)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078748/)

### What's your favorite quote?
Multiple, but the most fun one to use is from Conan the Barbarian (in the proper accent ofcourse).
*”Conan! What is best in life?”
”TO CRUSH YOUR ENEMIES, SEE THEM DRIVEN BEFORE YOU AND TO HEAR THE LAMENTATION OF THE WOMEN”*

### Is there anything that just bothers you without good reason?

Cooking instructions on food packaging. ‘Heat in a pre-heated oven on 250C for 5-7 minutes’. Why does it not just say 6 minutes?! It keeps me up at night.
