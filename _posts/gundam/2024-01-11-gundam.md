## Gundam?
Gundam! I feel Wikipedia gives the best explanation of what Gundam actually is, so here's a quote from the [Gundam wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gundam)!

>Gundam (Japanese: ガンダムシリーズ, Hepburn: Gandamu Shirīzu, lit. Gundam Series) is a Japanese military science fiction media franchise. Created by Yoshiyuki Tomino and Sunrise (now Bandai Namco Filmworks), the franchise features giant robots, or mecha, with the name "Gundam". The franchise began on April 7, 1979, with Mobile Suit Gundam, a TV series that defined the "real robot" mecha anime genre by featuring giant robots called mobile suits (including the original titular mecha) in a militaristic setting. The popularity of the series and its merchandise spawned a franchise that includes 50 TV series, films and OVAs as well as manga, novels and video games, along with a whole industry of plastic model kits known as Gunpla which makes up 90 percent of the Japanese character plastic-model market.

### Gunpla
I've always been interested in the Gundam model kits, otherwise known as Gunpla. Numerous times I have researched and looked at the model kits in amazement, but never got started. Thinking it was another nice Japenese thing that'll cost me loads in import costs and shipping.
Somehwere in the first half of 2023, during a bout of extreme boredom, I rebooted this researching journey and found out that there are quite a few Dutch retailers that stock Gundam model kits.
So, with my bad habit of buying stuff I don't necessarily need when I get bored, I ordered 2 model kits of the HG variant

#### Gunpla variants
Gundam model kits come in a quite a few variants and scales, but I will only list the ones that have my interest here;
* High Grade (HG) - 1:144 scale
* Real Grade (RG) - 1:144 scale
* Master Grade (MG) - 1:100 scale
* Perfect Grade (PG) - 1:60 scale

There are some variants to these scales and there are also a few more scales. For a comprehensive overview, I'll redirect you to [the wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpla#Grades)

## My Gunpla
As mentioned above, my journey into Gunpla started somewhere in the first half of 2023, when I bought my first two High Grade (HG) kits from a Dutch retailer. The main reason I was so interested in Gunpla was because these modelkits look amazing, have articulation and, most importantly, do not require _any_ glue. Everything fits and snaps together perfectly and you end up with an awesome looking robot, that is posable and sometimes insanely so.
